Orbit is a learning app that helps students actually understand what they study, instead of just finishing chapters.
Most students already have study material => notes, PDFs, slides, syllabus documents, and past exam questions.
The problem is not lack of content.
The problem is knowing what to study, in what order, and how well you actually understand it.
Students and anyone in general gets stuck in a loop of prompting , reviewing , new chats , “teach me like im’a 5 yo” ,
Orbit is aimed to solve that . Could also have support for dyslexia (later maybe)

How Orbit enhances studying
Orbit doesn’t change what you study, it improves how you study.
To do this, Orbit adds three learning supports on top of your existing material:

Confidence-based adaptation
Orbit adjusts what it teaches next based on how easily you answer questions, not just whether the answer is right or wrong.


Interactive simulations
When a concept is hard to understand with text alone, Orbit generates simulations so you can see and interact with the idea.


Optional attention support
If enabled, Orbit uses basic camera signals (like tiredness or distraction) to slow down, repeat, or suggest breaks when needed.


These supports work quietly in the background, helping you learn at the right pace without extra effort from you.



What you do in Orbit
You upload everything you already use for studying, such as:
class notes


PDFs


PowerPoint slides


syllabus documents


previous year questions



That’s it.
You don’t need to organize it yourself , or Do anything in general .

It works on the principle of  “Shut up and Learn”

What Orbit does with your material
Once the material is uploaded, Orbit analyzes and organizes it automatically.
It breaks the content into:
big topics


smaller subtopics


very small learning units (tiny ideas that can be learned quickly)


These small units are important because they let Orbit teach step by step, instead of dumping everything at once.
Each small unit is linked to the exact pages or slides it came from, so Orbit always stays relevant to your material  not random internet explanations.

But it Doesn't have to be given material necessarily , You could just type in to teach “ fastAPI” and it would work the same without any material.
How learning works in Orbit
Orbit teaches one small topic at a time.
You don’t have to ask:
“What should I study next?”


“Should I revise this?”


“Am I ready to move on?”


Orbit decides this for you.
It explains a topic, then gives you a few questions or activities to check understanding.
Based on how easily you answer, Orbit understands:
what you are confident in


what you partially understand


what you are struggling with
How Orbit adapts to you
Orbit doesn’t just mark answers as right or wrong.
It looks at how easily you got the answer:
right on the first try → you understand well


right after a few tries → you understand partially


many mistakes → you need more practice


Each small topic gets its own score.
Using these scores, Orbit:
spends more time on weak topics


revises topics you struggle with


moves faster through topics you already know


This way, no time is wasted repeating things you already understand.
How simulations are used
Some topics are hard to understand with text alone  especially topics involving:
movement


change over time


cause and effect


When Orbit detects such a topic, it generates interactive simulations.
These simulations let you:
change values


see what happens


understand concepts visually and intuitively


The simulations are created only when they are useful, not for every topic.
Optional attention support using the camera
Orbit can also use the camera only if you choose to allow it.
It does not read thoughts or emotions.
It only looks at simple signals such as:
blinking too much (possible tiredness)


looking away often


being stuck or confused for a long time

Looking like a retard ( orbit can’t solve this)



Using these signals, Orbit may:
slow down explanations


repeat an idea differently


suggest taking a short break


All camera processing happens on your device, and nothing is saved.
What makes Orbit different
Orbit is not:
a chatbot you keep prompting


a static notes app


a fixed online course


Orbit is a guided learning system.
It:
decides what to teach next


adapts based on your performance


revises weak areas automatically


adjusts learning speed to you


So the student can focus on understanding, not planning.

Why Orbit is not just another AI tutor
Many AI learning apps today work like this:
you upload notes, then chat with an AI that answers questions when you ask.
Orbit is fundamentally different.
Orbit does not wait for prompts.
You don’t have to keep asking what to study or what to do next.


Orbit does not respond randomly to questions.
It follows a structured learning plan built from your material.


Orbit does not teach everything at once.
It breaks content into small, focused learning steps and guides you through them.


Orbit does not rely only on conversation.
It teaches, tests, revises, and adapts automatically in the background.


Orbit does not act like a general-purpose AI.
It stays strictly grounded in your uploaded content and syllabus.


In short, Orbit is not an AI you talk to.
It is a learning system that thinks ahead for you.
